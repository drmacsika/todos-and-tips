My Macosx version is 11.1
Python version: 3.10.1


To install pytorch on Mac

torch-1.10.1-cp310-none-macosx_11_0_x86_64.whl

- pip install torch, if that doesn't work
- try to upgrade the pip and install again, if it still does not work
- Download the latest wheels from https://pypi.org/project/torch/#files
- You will get a file with the form: torch-1.10.1-cp39-none-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl
- Change the "cp39" on the name to march with your python version
for example, I am using python 3.10 so it becomes cp310.
- Change the macosx_10_9 to march your computers OS version e.g my Macosx version is 
11.1 os it becomes macosx_11_1



Run pip again but ths time using the location of the file:
For instance, if it is in downloads directory, run
pip install /Users/Macsika/Downloads/torch-1.10.1-cp310-none-macosx_11_0_x86_64.whl


This should do it.
